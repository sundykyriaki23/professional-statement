   PROFESSIONAL STATEMENT
 
 
My name is Sundy Kyriaki. I have 7 years of experience as a Director and I consider myself a very good organized person, I always take care for accuracy, safety, and the best outcome. Managing Appointments, and IT capabilities with Microsoft Suite, PowerPoints, and Excel operations are skills that I do and I am always trying to develop them; I learned how important is cybersecurity for the organization’s and people’s safety.
I  am very enthusiastic about information security and enjoy finding solutions that can positively impact an organization and the people it serves but I don’t have previous experience.
In cybersecurity, I found very interesting and attractive the operations that are used to protect organizations, people, networks, and devices and I am going to continue this development as far as I can.
Protecting people, assets, and organizations through safety operations and ensuring compliance with the law, are the basic steps and the biggest value for a cybersecurity professional. In addition, I place a high value on maintaining a strong security posture to help protect sensitive information and mitigate risks.
I love the ethos and respect everyone’s rights however I don’t forget their responsibilities.
My target is to cooperate with highly experienced cybersecurity professionals to develop my skills and to give my best to organizations and government services.
I want an entry-level cybersecurity position that will utilize my drive and thirst for knowledge.
My values and my will to succeed in what I undertake is a strength that can be used for the safety and protection of an organization.
